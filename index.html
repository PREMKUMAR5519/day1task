    <h2>Multiplexing:</h2>

    <p>HTTP/1.1: Uses a single connection for each request, which can lead to a phenomenon known as head-of-line
        blocking. If one resource is slow to load, it can block the loading of other resources.</p>
    <p>HTTP/2: Supports multiplexing, allowing multiple requests and responses to be sent and received in parallel
        over a single connection. This helps to overcome the head-of-line blocking issue and improves overall page
        loading speed.</p>

    <h2>Binary Protocol:</h2>

    <p>HTTP/1.1: Text-based protocol, which is human-readable but can be less efficient in terms of parsing and
        processing.</p>
    <p>HTTP/2: Binary protocol, which is more efficient for machines to parse and results in faster processing.</p>

    <h2>Resource Prioritization:</h2>

    <p>HTTP/1.1: No built-in support for prioritizing resources. All resources are treated equally.</p>
    <p>HTTP/2: Supports resource prioritization, allowing the server to specify the importance of different
        resources. This helps in loading critical resources first, improving page rendering speed.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">Objects And itsInternal Representations</h1>
    <h3>Objects:</h3>
    <p>In JavaScript, objects are a fundamental data type that allows you to store and organize data using key-value
        pairs. Objects can represent complex entities and are central to the language's flexibility and expressiveness.
        When it comes to their internal representations, understanding how JavaScript handles objects is crucial for
        efficient programming.</p>
    <h3>Internal Representations:</h3>
    <h5>Properties:</h5>
    <p>Objects in JavaScript consist of properties, where each property has a key and a corresponding value. The key is
        always a string or a symbol, and the value can be of any data type, including other objects.</p>
    <h5>Prototypes:</h5>
    <p>JavaScript uses a prototype-based inheritance model. Objects can inherit properties and methods from other
        objects through a prototype chain. If a property or method is not found on an object, JavaScript looks for it in
        the object's prototype, and so on, until the end of the chain.</p>
